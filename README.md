# react-spotify-player

A project built to learn how to use react with API endpoints and audio files.

1. Search for your favourite artists
2. Get an overview of your artist with their top 10 songs
3. Listen to a 30 second preview by clicking on an album cover

Known limitations:
- No error handling when searching for an artist that doesn't exist
- No error handling when playing a preview where the audio file url is not provided
- Play/Pause CSS button sometimes glitches on first play
- End of 30 second preview doesn't change pause button back to play
